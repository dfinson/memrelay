"""Render daemon results into agent-facing text (SPEC §4.3/§4.4, ``mcp/format.py``).

Recall (:func:`format_as_map`) renders the recalled subgraph as a Mermaid ``graph
LR`` diagram plus a scannable key-facts list with drill-down hints (SPEC §4.3). The
diagram is *always* syntactically valid Mermaid regardless of the free-text node and
edge labels: every label is emitted double-quoted through :func:`_mermaid_label`
(which strips newlines/control chars and neutralizes quote/angle characters), nodes
use stable synthetic ids (``n0``, ``n1``, … in input order), and every node is
declared before any edge references it. The shapes consumed here match the daemon
wire schema, so they do not change when the real engine lands.

Recall additionally reduces the rendered subgraph to the *relevant* nodes (E8-S2,
``mcp/format.py``): using the node-aligned reranker ``scores`` it keeps nodes at or above
the median score, tightens to a natural score gap when one dominates, and rescues
well-connected nodes (``>= _RELEVANCE_MIN_DEGREE`` incident edges) so structural hubs
survive. This is a display-only reduction — the raw recall the retrieval eval measures is
untouched — and it never turns a non-empty result into the not-found text.

Recall then renders each kept node at a *density tier* proportional to its score (E8-S3,
``mcp/format.py``): a node whose score is at or above the median of the kept scores is
"high" and rendered in full — its ``summary`` (facts) plus its edges — while a lower-scored
node stays "compact", showing only its name and a drill-down hint (its ``uuid`` handle is
always kept, so every entity stays resolvable). An edge is rendered when at least one
endpoint is high, so a high node keeps all of its links (and a degree-rescued hub keeps its
link to the core) while a link solely between two compact nodes is left for drill-down. The
tiering is display-only and pure: with no numeric scores every node is high (identical to
pre-E8-S3), and the top-scored node is always high, so a non-empty result never collapses to
the not-found text.

Recall finally caps the rendered map to a token budget (E8-S4, ``mcp/format.py``): after
selection and tiering it keeps the highest-scored nodes down until the ``### Entities`` detail
would exceed :data:`_MAX_MAP_CHARS` (a deterministic character proxy for tokens), so recall
stays fast and never blows the caller's context window. The single top-scored node is always
rendered — even if it alone exceeds the budget — so a real recall is never emptied, and a
budget-dropped node leaves both the node list and the edge/visible-edge lists (mermaid and
``### Relationships`` stay in sync, exactly as a selection-dropped node does). The cut is
display-only and pure — it never reorders or rescores the ranking the retrieval eval reads — so
the same recall renders byte-identically every time. The engine guards recall latency
separately (``engine/graphiti.py``): a search that exceeds its timeout yields an empty-but-valid
result here rather than raising.

    :func:`_mermaid_map`); an empty result keeps the plain not-found text.

    Before rendering, the returned nodes are reduced to the relevant subgraph via
    :func:`_select_indices` (score median + natural-gap cut, with a degree-based rescue —
    E8-S2). Kept nodes render in input order, so the synthetic ``n0``, ``n1`` ids and any
