"""The spool → Graphiti ingester: drain the durable spool into memory (E4-S5 #37).

:class:`Ingester` is the long-lived reader half of the ingest path. It repeatedly
pulls a batch of episodes off the :class:`~memrelay.ingest.spool.Spool`, notes each
one into the injected memory engine, and checkpoints it — turning durable-but-inert
spool rows into recallable graph memory.

Two robustness properties matter for a background loop the daemon never babysits:

* **Poison tolerance.** A single record that makes ``engine.note`` raise is logged
  and *skipped* — its ``seq`` is still checkpointed so it can never wedge the cursor
  or be retried forever, and the loop keeps going. One bad episode must not stall
  ingest for every episode behind it.
* **Idle backoff.** When the spool is empty the loop waits (interruptibly) instead
  of spinning, and wakes immediately when ``stop`` is set for a prompt shutdown.

The engine and spool are injected and only duck-typed (``await engine.note(...)``,
``spool.read_batch/checkpoint/pending``), so the loop unit-tests against fakes with
no Kuzu and no network.
